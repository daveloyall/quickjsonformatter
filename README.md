quickjsonformatter
==================
First off, this json formatter was made by @vbodurov and he hosted it at http://www.bodurov.com/JsonFormatter/ for years and I consider it to be the "best" in-browser json formatter.

He made the code available via Codeplex and also commented that the code is of course also available via the ol' "view source" method. :)

I asked @vbodurov if I could import the project to Github and he said yes.  Why should I bother to import this to Github?  Because, I saw someone else on Github describe an inferior json formatter as "the best".

Features 
--------
* pretty printing
* syntax coloring
* interactive folding
* dynamic folding
* copy/paste of output works well
* permlink feature (all state saved in GET url)
* interactive configuration
* easily adapted for use inside other projects
