quickjsonformatter
==================
First off, this json formatter was made by [@vbodurov](https://github.com/vbodurov) and he is still hosting it on [his personal website](http://www.bodurov.com/JsonFormatter/) as he has been doing for years.  I consider it to be the "best" in-browser json formatter.

He made the code available via Codeplex and also commented that the code is of course also available via the ol' "view source" method. :)

I asked @vbodurov if I could import the project to Github and he said yes.  Why should I bother to import this to Github?  Because, I saw someone else on Github describe an inferior json formatter as "the best". :)
